# Project Management

## Branching Strategy
We used a **feature branch strategy** with a **development branch (Dev-Branch)**. New features were developed in separate feature branches and merged into the Dev-Branch after a successful code review.

## Agile Approach
We worked with **Scrum** and managed our tasks in **Jira**. Our sprint structure was as follows:

- **Sprints:** Weekly sprints  
- **Sprint Planning:** Every Saturday  
- **Sprint Review:** Every Saturday  
- **Tickets:** Tasks were created as Jira tickets and prioritized  

## Code Review Process
Each merge request (MR) had to be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged into the Dev-Branch. This ensured that the code remained high quality and consistent.

## Communication
- Weekly meetings on **Saturday and Wednesday** for planning and review  
- Additionally, we regularly exchanged updates in person at the university regarding current issues and topics  

## Potential Improvements
For future projects, introducing **automated testing** and a **CI/CD pipeline** could be beneficial to further optimize the development process.
