A very good guide to installing Flutter and all necessary components includes the following steps:

1. Download and set up Flutter SDK

Visit flutter.dev and download the latest Flutter SDK for your operating system.

Unzip the SDK to a folder without administrator rights, e.g. C:\flutter for Windows.

Add the path to the Flutter bin directory to the PATH environment variable.

2. Install dependencies

Android Studio

Download and install Android Studio from developer.android.com.

Run the Android Studio Setup Wizard to install additional dependencies.

Install the Flutter plugin from the Marketplace in Android Studio.

Visual Studio Code (alternative)

Install Visual Studio Code and the Flutter plugin.

3. Verify Flutter installation

Open a terminal or PowerShell.

Run the flutter doctor command to verify the installation and identify missing dependencies.

4. Set up the emulator

Open the AVD Manager in Android Studio.

Create a virtual Android device for testing your apps.

5. Create your first project

Open your preferred IDE (Android Studio or VS Code).

Create a new Flutter project via the IDE or using the flutter create my_first_project command in the terminal.

6. Run the app

Start the emulator or connect a physical device.

Run the app using the flutter run command in the project directory.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of installing and setting up Flutter. Note that the exact steps may vary depending on your operating system. It is recommended to consult the official Flutter documentation for detailed, operating system-specific instructions
